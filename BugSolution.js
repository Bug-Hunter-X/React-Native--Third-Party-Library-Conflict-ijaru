The solution depends on the specific libraries involved.  Common solutions include:
1. **Update libraries:** Check for newer versions of your third-party libraries that address compatibility issues.  Use npm update or yarn upgrade.
2. **Check version compatibility:** Ensure all your libraries are compatible with each other and with your React Native version. Refer to each library's documentation.
3. **Use compatible versions:**  If updates don't work, try using specific versions of libraries that are known to work together.  Lock versions in your package.json.
4. **Refactor conflicting code:**  If conflicts persist, examine the code where the libraries interact.  You might need to refactor the code to avoid direct conflicts. 
5. **Use different libraries:**  As a last resort, consider alternative libraries with known compatibility.
